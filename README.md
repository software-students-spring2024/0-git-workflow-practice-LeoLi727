## Why is it interesting
This article is interesting because it is different from many people's traditional cognition. It suggests that we should write code for easy deletion instead of for easy extension. Such a new idea will help reduce maintainance costs and solve the issue of code reusability. Besides, it increases the flexibility during the development process to adapt to potential changes in technologies and customer requirements.
